# Compiling example binaries

I suggest compiling binaries for this emulator with [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/), they are written in the old-style syntax If you want to compile these binaries with vasm you can do it like this:

```
make
```
(you can change the name of your assembler at the top of the Makefile)

Big shout out to Volker Barthelmann and Frank Wille!
