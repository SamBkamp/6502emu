# Compiling example binaries

I suggest compiling binaries for this emulator with [vasm](http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/), they are written in the old-style syntax If you want to compile these binaries with vasm you can do it like this:

```
vasm -Fbin -dotdir -o <ofile> <ifile.vasm>
```

Big shout out to Volker Barthelmann and Frank Wille!
